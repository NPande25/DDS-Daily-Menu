# Daily Menu Chrome Extension

Fully functional chrome extension to show the daily DDS Menu, including specials at each of the dining halls. The extension uses Python and Django on the backend, connecting to an HTML/CSS/JS front end through the Django server. This app implements the following process:
* Uses Python web scraping to gather daily menu data from the Dartmouth Dining website
* Implements a Django backend server to fetch scraped data by the Python scripts
* Dynamically inserts menu data into the template with Javascript
